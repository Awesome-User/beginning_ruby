IO::SEEK_CUR: Seeks a certain number of bytes ahead of the 
	current position.

IO::SEEK_END: Seeks to a position based on the end of the file. 
	This means that to seek to a certain position from the end of 
	the file, youâ€™ll probably need to use a negative value.

IO::SEEK_SET: Seeks to an absolute position in the file. This is 
	identical to pos=.
