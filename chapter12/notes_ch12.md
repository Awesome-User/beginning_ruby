# chapter 12

##### covering the basics of building a larger application.

basic concepts/techniques covered: 

- flowcharting / testing / basic refactoring

#### what we are building

- building a bot capable of chatting with us.
- history of bots: 
	- in 1960s MIT scientist Joseph Weizenbaum developed a bot called ELIZA. 


#### why a bot?

- can be simple or as complex as we like, so we (or the reader i guess) can extend the bot as much as he/she feels like it. 

- other stuff: project will let us put together a lot of what we've learned so far. 

... notes ... refer to 309 for a refresher. 

##### basic bot operations flowchart 

start -> accept user input -> clean up / expand text -> split input into sentences and words -> find viable responses from phrase sets -> switch object senses for response -> substitute user phrases into response phrases -> return result to user -> end
