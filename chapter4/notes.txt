# (making a)text analyzer:

# features:
	- character count
	- character count (excluding spaces)
	- line count
	- word count
	- sentence count
	- paragraph count
	- avg. words per sentence
	- avg. sentences per paragraph

# outlining basic steps:

	1. load file containing text that we want analyzed
	2. keep count of how many lines there were, as the file is loading
	3. put text in string to measure its length and get character count. 
	4. temporarily remove whitespace and measure the length of resulting string to get char count (excluding spaces). 
	5. split out white spaces to find out how many words there are
	6. split out full stops to find out how many sentences there are
	7. split on double newlines to find out how many paragraphs there are.
	8. perform calculations to work out the averages.
